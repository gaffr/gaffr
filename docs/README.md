# Docs Folder

This directory is for documentation. We'll figure that out later. It'll probably be a combination of one or more of the following.

## C++ Source Docs

This will be the primary concern. We will use one of the following tools:

- Doxygen
- Sphinx

## General usage docs

This will require writing a man page as well as some general CLI usage docs. For these purposes other tools may be more suitable. We'll tackle those problems as we come to them.
